Deep Learning Approaches to Drought Prediction
==============================

### **Introduction**

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Deep Learning Approaches to Drought Prediction**. This project explores the application of advanced deep learning models to predict drought conditions with improved accuracy and timeliness.  We aim to develop AI-driven solutions that support climate resilience and water resource management.

Drought is a significant natural disaster that impacts agriculture, water resources, ecosystems, and socio-economic activities. Early warning systems play a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of drought by providing timely information to decision-makers. 

Ethiopia frequently experiences devastating droughts that severely impact agricultural production and food security for millions of people. To mitigate the impacts of these extrem events , we need to develop accurate and reliable drought prediction models. This project aims to develop a deep learning-based drought prediction model that uses the state-of-the-art data driven modeling techniques to predict drought conditions with high accuracy at sufficient lag/lead times.





 Machine/Deep learning techniques have the potential to revolutionize drought forecasting by improving accuracy and lead time. By leveraging advanced data analytics and deep learning algorithms, more accurate and realable drought prediction models can be developed.
 
 Our work focuses on employing cutting-edge techniques, such as **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks**, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, and **Transformer** models, to analyze complex spatio-temporal patterns of drought. Drought predictions can help decision-makers mitigate the impacts of droughts and plan for sustainable resource allocation.

The overarching goals of the project are:  
1. Prepare and compile features/predictors from various datasets relevant for drought prediction.  
2. Calculate the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) as a standardized drought indicator.  
3. Implement and evaluate deep learning models for drought prediction.   
4. Develop a machine learning workflow that is both reproducible and scalable to other regions or predictors. 
5. Develop actionable early warning tool to support decision-making.
