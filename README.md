Deep Learning Approaches to Drought Prediction
==============================

### **Introduction**

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Deep Learning Approaches to Drought Prediction**. This project explores the application of advanced deep learning models to predict drought conditions with improved accuracy and timeliness.  We aim to develop AI-driven solutions that support climate resilience and water resource management.

Drought is a significant natural disaster that impacts agriculture, water resources, ecosystems, and socio-economic activities. Early warning systems play a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of drought by providing timely information to decision-makers. Machine/Deep learning techniques have the potential to revolutionize drought forecasting by improving accuracy and lead time.

Our work focuses on employing cutting-edge techniques, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transformer models, to analyze complex spatio-temporal patterns of drought. Drought predictions can help decision-makers mitigate the impacts of droughts and plan for sustainable resource allocation.

This repository includes:
- **Code and Models:** Implementation of deep learning architectures for drought prediction.
- **Datasets:** Data preprocessing steps and preprocessed datasets used for training and testing of ML/DL models.
- **Documentation:** Step-by-step guides for replicating the experiments.
- **Visualization Tools:** Visualize drought patterns and model outputs.
